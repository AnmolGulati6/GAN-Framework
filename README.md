# PyTorch GAN Framework

GAN-Framework, a flexible toolkit for building and training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using PyTorch. Whether you are a student, researcher, or developer, this provides an accessible platform to experiment with GAN models.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Easy to customize and extend. Experiment with different GAN architectures seamlessly.
- **Pre-built Models**: Includes implementations of common GAN components and architectures.
- **Visualization Tools**: Integrated plotting tools to visualize training progress and results.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnmolGulati6/GAN-Framework.git
```

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and PyTorch 1.7+ installed. You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example to get you started:

```python
from GAN-Framework import generator, discriminator, run_a_gan

# Initialize generator and discriminator
G = generator()
D = discriminator()

# Train your GAN
run_a_gan(D, G)
```

This simple example initializes a basic GAN and runs the training loop.
